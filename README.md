# Dronemeld

A mod for Risk of Rain 2. Built with BepInEx and R2API.

Merges drones of the same type, increasing their stats.

## Installation

Release builds are published to Thunderstore: https://thunderstore.io/package/ThinkInvis/Dronemeld/

**Use of a mod manager is recommended**. If not using a mod manager: extract ThinkInvis-Dronemeld-[version].zip into your BepInEx plugins folder such that the following path exists: `[RoR2 game folder]/BepInEx/Plugins/ThinkInvis-Dronemeld-[version]/Dronemeld.dll`.
Installation of TILER2 is also required: https://thunderstore.io/package/ThinkInvis/TILER2/

## Building

Building Dronemeld locally will expect TILER2 to be built in parallel solution folders. If this is not the case, you will need to specify the reference path to this DLL manually.
