See below some common problems with feature requests. **Your issue may be closed without support if any of these are true**:

- *The issue is a content request.* Content requests (new items, artifacts, equipments, etc.) are not currently being accepted for this mod. Feature requests should only be used to suggest improvements, balance changes, etc. to existing content. Otherwise, consult [the #ideas channel in the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Discord](https://discord.com/channels/562704639141740588/562762617760776195) instead.
- *The issue contains multiple feature requests.* This makes tracking progress and organizing feedback much more difficult. Please open a separate issue for each distinct idea.
